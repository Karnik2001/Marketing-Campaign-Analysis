# Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis

This project analyzes multi-channel marketing campaign data to evaluate campaign effectiveness, identify key performance drivers, and build predictive models for conversion rates.

## Project Overview

The dataset contained inconsistent formatting, duplicates, and missing values. The project focused on cleaning the data, engineering marketing KPIs, and applying machine learning techniques to generate meaningful insights.

## Key Steps

- Data Cleaning: Standardized dates, corrected channel names, handled missing values, removed duplicates.

- Feature Engineering: Calculated CTR, CPC, CPA, and Conversion Rate.

- Exploratory Analysis: Channel-level comparison, time-based trends, and correlation studies.

- Statistical Testing: Conducted Breusch–Pagan test for heteroskedasticity.

- Modeling: Built multiple regressors — Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees, and a Voting Regressor.

## Results

Best-performing model: Voting Regressor

- R² Score: ~0.75

Identified channel-level differences in cost efficiency and conversion behavior.
